# Clustering-enhanced Local D-optimality

Users are encouraged to apply any clustering method to partition the dataset. Our approach was as follows:

Partition: We used PRM2020 labels to divide the dataset into 15 subsets.

Train: We trained 15 different ACE potentials (one for each subset).

Evaluate: We calculated 15 γ values for each atom and selected the minimum value.
